Backend API for MoFresh, a cold chain management system for Rwanda's agricultural sector.

## Overview

MoFresh Backend is a NestJS-based REST API that manages cold chain operations across three physical sites in Rwanda (Kigali, Musanze, and Rubavu). The system handles product inventory, cold room capacity tracking, order processing, automated invoicing, and payment integration with MOMO Rwanda.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: NestJS 11.x
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **ORM**: Prisma 6.x
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Payment Integration**: MOMO SandBox
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest with Supertest

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- PostgreSQL 15.x or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized development)

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup

Run the automated setup script to configure the entire development environment:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Create environment configuration from template
2. Install all dependencies
3. Start PostgreSQL via Docker
4. Generate Prisma Client
5. Run database migrations
6. Seed database with sample data
7. Build the application

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or need to troubleshoot:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Set up database:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Docker Setup

Seed the database:

```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run prisma:seed
```

### Production Environment

Use the production Docker Compose configuration:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Environment Configuration

```

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation:

**Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

The documentation is auto-generated from code annotations and provides:
- Complete API endpoint listing
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected endpoints:

1. Obtain access token via login endpoint
2. Include token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
3. Refresh tokens are used for extended sessions

### Default Credentials (Development Only)

After running the seed script, the following test accounts are available:

**Super Admin**
- Email: `admin@mofresh.rw`
- Password: `Password123!`

**Site Manager (Kigali)**
- Email: `manager1@mofresh.rw`
- Password: `Password123!`

**Site Manager (Musanze)**
- Email: `manager2@mofresh.rw`
- Password: `Password123!`

**Supplier**
- Email: `supplier1@mofresh.rw`
- Password: `Password123!`

**Client**
- Email: `client1@example.rw`
- Password: `Password123!`

**Important**: Change these credentials before deploying to production.

## Database Schema

The database uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Key entities include:

- **Users**: System users with role-based access control
- **Sites**: Three physical locations (Kigali, Musanze, Rubavu)
- **Cold Rooms**: Temperature-controlled storage facilities
- **Products**: Inventory items with stock tracking
- **Orders**: Customer orders with approval workflow
- **Invoices**: Auto-generated billing documents
- **Payments**: Payment processing via MOMO
- **Rentals**: Cold box, cold plate, and tricycle rentals
- **Audit Logs**: Complete activity tracking

### Roles and Permissions

The system implements role-based access control with four user roles:

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full system access across all sites
- **SITE_MANAGER**: Manages operations for assigned site
- **SUPPLIER**: Provides products to the system
- **CLIENT**: Places orders and requests rentals

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing with the following structure:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual services and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete API workflows

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory.

Target: Minimum 80% code coverage

## Continuous Integration

The project uses CircleCI for continuous integration. The pipeline includes:

1. **Dependencies**: Install and cache npm packages
2. **Lint**: Code quality checks with ESLint
3. **Test**: Unit and E2E tests with PostgreSQL
4. **SonarQube**: Static code analysis
5. **Coveralls**: Coverage tracking
6. **Build**: Production bundle creation

## Code Quality

### Linting

ESLint is configured with TypeScript rules. Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Formatting

Prettier handles code formatting. Format code:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Static Analysis

SonarQube analyzes code quality. Configuration is in `sonar-project.properties`.

### Coverage

Coveralls tracks test coverage trends. Configuration is in `.coveralls.yml`.

## Security

The application implements multiple security layers:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with guards
- **Input Validation**: Class-validator for request validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttler to prevent abuse
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js for HTTP security
- **CORS**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma parameterized queries

### Security Best Practices

1. Never commit `.env` file with real credentials
2. Use strong JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
3. Rotate secrets regularly in production
4. Enable HTTPS/TLS in production
5. Configure rate limiting based on your needs
6. Review audit logs regularly

## Multi-Site Architecture

The system supports three physical sites with data isolation:

- Site Managers can only access their assigned site data
- Super Admins can access data across all sites
- Suppliers and Clients are scoped to their site
- Site context is enforced via guards

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Set strong JWT secrets
- [ ] Configure MOMO credentials
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Review security settings

### Database Migrations

In production, use the deploy command:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

This applies pending migrations without prompting for confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is occupied:

```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

Or change the PORT in `.env`

### Database Connection Error

Verify PostgreSQL is running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
```

Check DATABASE_URL in `.env` is correct.

### Prisma Client Out of Sync

Regenerate Prisma Client:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

### Migration Conflicts

Reset database (development only):

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:reset
```

Warning: This deletes all data.

## Performance Considerations

- Database connection pooling is enabled by default via Prisma
- Response compression is enabled via middleware
- Pagination should be implemented for list endpoints
- Consider Redis caching for frequently accessed reports
- Monitor database query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run linter and tests locally
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push and create pull request
6. Wait for CI pipeline to pass
7. Request code review
8. Merge after approval

### Code Review Checklist
